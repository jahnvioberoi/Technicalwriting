   ```eg [Text to be displayed](filename)```
   
2. Header 2/3 - cross reference to any sub heading

   For md tables - the format gets a little complex so instead use a table generator
   

**Image**-

```
![imager caption](image url)
```

To resize the image, open it in paint, resize it, and commit 

To create a new sectino in md - either create a new typore file or do it using gitlab (recommended - typora - easier)

`<somecommand>` if there's any command in angular brackets, write it in codeph otherwise the compiler will think that it is an html command and show error
